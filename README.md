What is DZcoin?
----------------

DZcoin is an experimental local digital currency for Algerian citizens. DZcoin
enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in Algeria. 
DZcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. 

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the DZcoin Core software, see https://dzcoin.org/en/download, or read the
[original whitepaper](https://dzcoincore.org/dzcoin.pdf).
